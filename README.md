## Language

[English](./README.md) | [中文](./README_CN.md)

## Project Introduction
 I have built a multi-layer fully connected neural network using TensorFlow and trained it on several standard face datasets. This repository documents the model structure, training procedures, and key experimental results.

## Files

- `src/*`: Source code related to model training and evaluation.

- `dataset/*`: Compressed data set packages. Please manually extract them before running the code.

- `dataset/*`: Before running the code，plz [download dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset/code) and unzip into this directory。
